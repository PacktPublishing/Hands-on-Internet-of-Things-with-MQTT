This is the code repository for [Hands-On Internet of Things with MQTT](https://www.packtpub.com/in/hardware-and-creative/hands-internet-things-mqtt?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789341782), published by Packt.

**Build connected IoT devices with Arduino and MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT)**

## What is this book about?
MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT) is a lightweight messaging protocol for smart devices that can be used to build exciting, highly scalable Internet of Things (IoT) projects.

This book will get you started with a quick introduction to the concepts of IoT and MQTT and explain how the latter can help you build your own internet-connected prototypes. As you advance, you’ll gain insights into how microcontrollers communicate, and you'll get to grips with the different messaging protocols and techniques involved. Once you are well-versed with the essential concepts, you’ll be able to put what you’ve learned into practice by building three projects from scratch, including an automatic pet food dispenser and a smart e-ink to-do display. You’ll also discover how to present your own prototypes professionally. In addition to this, you'll learn how to use technologies from third-party web service providers, along with other rapid prototyping technologies, such as laser cutting, 3D printing, and PCB production.

By the end of this book, you’ll have gained hands-on experience in using MQTT to build your own IoT prototypes.

This book covers the following exciting features:

* Explore MQTT programming with Arduino
* Discover how to make your prototypes talk to each other
* Send MQTT messages from your smartphone to your prototypes
* Discover how you can make websites interact with your prototypes
* Learn about MQTT servers, libraries, and apps
* Explore tools such as laser cutting and 3D printing in order to build robust prototype cases

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Ch05.

**Following is what you need for this book:**

This book is ideal for readers who want to start creating internet-connected projects themselves, but only have a little bit of experience of programming and using the Arduino IDE. You do not need to have a computer science background to follow along. Simply curiosity and a basic understanding of programming in Arduino will be enough. If you understand basic programming concepts such as variables, loops, conditions, and functions, then you will have no problem following along.

Some of the chapters touch on a lot of different topics. I do not expect you to understand every single bit in detail. The goal here is to give you a general overview of related technologies and techniques, so you can dive into any of the topics after finishing the book. You can look at it as a starting point for IoT prototyping.

For an intermediate or professional programmer, the pace of the hands-on projects in this book might feel a bit slow, but there is plenty of relevant information for you in the theoretical chapters as well, including how to use MQTT.
